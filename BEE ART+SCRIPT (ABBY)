SCRIPT 

SAD INTRO: 

(INSERT ART) GRANDPA BEE: A long time ago, when all was well, the bees were happy, the honey was plentiful, and the children were frolicking. But one faithful day, horror struck. The wasp colony attacked. Without warning, they stripped us of our home. Burning our hives to the ground. (INSERT ART)


All was lost in the fire….. Including my beloved grobby poo. She was the light of my life, but now, she burns. I live with my agony every day. (INSERT ART)

(INSERT ART) Ehem... anyway. Legend has it that beyond the great vast land lies one last hive. It is up to you to find it and continue the bee-autiful life. Collect honey along the way, give it to the hive as an offering and a means of aid from the wasp attack. Honey is at an all-time low thanks to the wasps. The bees are too scared to leave their hives. 

Here, a sacred jar to collect honey. But beware… the wasps are still buzzing around. 

(SLOW FADE TO LEVEL ONE)


LEVEL ONE: “THE BACKYARD BEE”

(BEFORE LEVEL STARTS)
GRANDPA BEE: BEE-CAREFUL… you take damage from wasps. Use WASD to fly up and down. To collect honey, fly near it. But watch out, wasps like honey too…

ENDING OF LEVEL ONE: 
GRANDPA BEE: I cannot BEE-lieve you managed to collect enough pollen. Grandpa is so proud. But not proud enough. You still have a long way to go before you reach the hive. Dont tell me you thought THAT was enough honey to give to LAST BEE COLONY.

BACKPACK BEE: HOWDY DOO! I thought I was the last bee! 

GRANDPA BEE: jumpscare… what's with the pouch?

BILL THE BACKPACK BEE: I use it to store loads of pollen and my backpack transforms it into honey!

GRANDPA BEE: Hmm, that definitely makes sense.  you seem to know what you're doing.. You two should join teams. With this “backpack bee,” you should be able to collect WAY more honey now! 

( POP UP ON SCREEN) “YOU'VE UNLOCKED BACKPACK BEE”
He can carry pollen! What else did you expect?
BackPack Bee can help you carry more pollen! With his magic, funky backpack, he can help turn pollen into honey.

LEVEL TWO: “POLLEN PARK”

(BEFORE LEVEL STARTS)
BACKPACK BEE: I HEAR THE PARK HAS TULIPS! THEY ARE CARRYING SO MUCH POLLEN, WHICH MEANS MORE HONEY! 

LEVEL TWO ENDING:
GRANDPA BEE: WOW! GREAT JOB YOU TWO YOU ALMOST HAVE ENOUGH-
(MILITARY BEE APPEARS ON SCREEN) 
MILITARY BEE: Not so fast, Gramps. What do you bees think you're doing in my neck of the woods?

BACKBACK BEE: This is a park. 

MILITARY BEE: I LOST EVERYTHING HERE. I RETURNED FROM DEPLOYMENT TO FIND MY HIVE BURNED TO THE GROUND.

GRANDAPA BEE: I feel ya, kid.. I fought in the war of InBEEpendance, but we dont have time to chat. These bees are on the way to the last hive.

Military bee: say no more. I'll tag along if it means so get to blow one of those waps heads off.

GRANDAPA BEE: LET'S keep the PG rating..

(POP UP ON SCREEN) “YOU'VE UNLOCKED MILITARY BEE”
You thought you had trauma? He has trauma packed into an AK.”

LEVEL THREE: “SanFranBuzzo”

(THIS LEVEL HAS VERY FEW FLOWERS)



Military bee: There's like no flowers here… can't we take another route? 

GRANDPA BEE: No, my BeeMaps says this is the only toll-free way. I do hear the city is crawling with wasps, though.

Military Bee: Say less.

ENDING OF LEVEL THREE: 

GRANDPA BEE: Yikes.. You kids look like you've been THROUGH it. At least you survived, though. sorta.

CYBEE: beep boo bop bee

ALL BEES: !!!!

Military Bee: Ok, I think we are losing the plot.

GRANDPA BEE: NONSENSE *mutters* must have been a diversity call.

“You've unlocked Cybee.”
Beep boop bop. 
Cybee is fast, fast enough to warn you about wasps, but not fast enough to dodge the Cyber Truck claims ”

LEVEL FOUR: THE FOREST

GRANDPA BEE: My hips are not what they used to be.

Cybee: You dont have hips

Grandpa Bee: I dont speak Siri.

Military Bee: The hive must be up ahead.. Which means WASPS are waiting

Bill the Backback bee: LET'S OBLITERATE THEM

Grandpa Bee: I agree with Bill

(LOTS OF WASPS COME AS THE PLAYER RUSHES TO THE END)


END OF LEVEL 4:

Grandpa Bee: We did it… You all actually did it.. Grandpa IS SO PROUD OF ALL YOU.

Bill the Backpack Bee: Wow! Look at the size of that hive!

*fades to show new hive/home* ART

BOUGIE BEE: WHY HELLO THERE! You must be the brave bees that said our hive!

Cyber: Beep boop beep bop beeeeeep!

BOUGIE BEE: Yes, yes, well, I can't say thank you enough. You all should stay with us. Together, we can rebuild our hive with the honey you collected.
Grandpa Bee: Shouldn't you ask the queen?

BOUGIE BEE: It's 2025, Gramps, I am the queen.

Grandpa Bee: Ah, yes… my mistake.

Backpack Bee: ehem... Thank you, your majesty! We'd love to stay.

BOUGIE BEE: Well, of COURSE YOU WOULD *rich laugh* come now, I'll show you to your new home.

(ALL BEES START GOING ACROSS THE SCREEN TO THE NEW HIVE, PETER STAYS)

Grandpa Bee: You coming?

Peter: You go on without me, there's still work left undone

ALL BEES (besides grandpa): YOU CAN TALK?

Peter: We may have gathered honey to make honeycomb to build the hives, but I feel like something's still missing.

Grandpa: Pollen: missing you, say..

Peter: Yes..

BOUGIE BEE: Well, we could use some pollen, those wasps really wiped out our pollen collectors..

Peter: I can help.

BOUGIE BEE: That would be quite helpful. But you've already done so much.

Peter: If there's more work to be done. Then im the bee to do it

BOUGIE BEE: Im sorry, I dont believe you ever told me your name

Peter: It's Peter, Peter the Pollen Collector
